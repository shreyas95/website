# Veritas Technologies LLC
### Assoc. Software Engineer (July 2016 - Present)
After completion of undergraduate studies, I received an opportunity to work with this company. I was fortunate to get a chance to work on the company’s main product, named Backup Exec. I fixed few customer escalations and defects in the product along with contributing to automation framework that helped reduce testing time. Currently, I am working on a feature for checking bootability of backed up virtual machines.

### Intern (November 2014 - January 2015)
I worked on a ‘Generic Form Generator’ which could save time while building websites. The project was developed using Django framework, Jquery, and MongoDB.
